# shopify-blank-theme
A (mostly) blank shopify theme – bare minimum empty files, no css or js, and just enough html/liquid to display content on the page. Everybody has their own definition of "blank" – this is like if you turned the dial down to zero, and then just 1 or 2 clicks to the right again.
